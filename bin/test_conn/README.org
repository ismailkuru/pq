Simple test of connections. Start receiver first, then sender. FIXME
can probably remove some of the Thread.delays.

FIXME receiver sometimes dies with "Fatal error: out of memory."; but
it doesn't look like any memory is being used... except in the network
connection buffer?

If we ping back from the receiver then everything is very slow
again. Round-trip latency? Not sure what the problem is.
